  <h1>Step 2: How to get a wetsuit</h1>
  <p>When picking a wetsuit, it is important to know the different thicknesses of the wetsuits themselves,
     the size of the wetsuit, and what kind of zipper/hood is on the wetsuit. Wetsuits will keep your body 
     temperature warm throughout the entire surf session so you don't have to get out from the cold. There 
     are two types of wetsuits that I recommend BACK ZIP and CHEST ZIP. Back zips are easier to get on, but 
     let more water in, while Chest zips are harder to put on, but let's less water in.
     
     Thicknesses of wetsuits:
     
     2/1 mm wetsuits are for warm waters
     3/2 mm wetsuits are for medium waters
     4/3 mm wetsuits are for cold winter waters </p>
